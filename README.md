## Overview
This repository provides an R package that implements the methods described in [Linear-Cost Vecchia Approximation of Multivariate Normal Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09426). The methods are a combination of the [Vecchia approximation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345768) and the [min-max exponential tilting method](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44681765) that enable scalable estimation of multivariate normal (MVN) probabilities, multivariate Student-t (MVT) probabilities. The package is published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VeccTMVN/index.html).

## Installation
Simply running `install.packages("VeccTMVN")` in R should work.
